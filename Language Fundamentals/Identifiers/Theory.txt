A name in Java Programs is called Identifiers which can be used for Identification purpose. It can be method name or variable name, class name or Label name.


Rules for Defining Java Identifiers:
1. The only characters that are allowed for naming (a-z), (A-Z), (0-9), ($,_). If we use any other character we will get compile time error.
2. Identifiers should not start with digits. Example 123total is invalid. We will get compile time error.
3. Java Identifiers are case sensitive. Off course Java Language itself treated as Case Sensitive Programming Language.
4. There is no length limit for Java Identifiers.
5. We can't use reserved words as Identifiers.
